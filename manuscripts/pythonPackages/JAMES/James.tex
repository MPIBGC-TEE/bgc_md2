%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  TITLE
%
% (A title should be specific, informative, and brief. Use
% abbreviations only if they are defined in the abstract. Titles that
% start with general keywords then specific terms are optimized in
% searches)
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Example: \title{This is a test title}

\title{=enter title here=}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  AUTHORS AND AFFILIATIONS
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Authors are individuals who have significantly contributed to the
% research and preparation of the article. Group authors are allowed, if
% each author in the group is separately identified in an appendix.)

% List authors by first name or initial followed by last name and
% separated by commas. Use \affil{} to number affiliations, and
% \thanks{} for author notes.
% Additional author notes should be indicated with \thanks{} (for
% example, for current addresses).

% Example: \authors{A. B. Author\affil{1}\thanks{Current address, Antartica}, B. C. Author\affil{2,3}, and D. E.
% Author\affil{3,4}\thanks{Also funded by Monsanto.}}

\authors{=list all authors here=}


% \affiliation{1}{First Affiliation}
% \affiliation{2}{Second Affiliation}
% \affiliation{3}{Third Affiliation}
% \affiliation{4}{Fourth Affiliation}

\affiliation{=number=}{=Affiliation Address=}
%(repeat as many times as is necessary)


% Corresponding author mailing address and e-mail address:

% (include name and email addresses of the corresponding author.  More
% than one corresponding author is allowed in this LaTeX file and for
% publication; but only one corresponding author is allowed in our
% editorial system.)

% Example: \correspondingauthor{First and Last Name}{email@address.edu}

\correspondingauthor{=name=}{=email address=}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% KEY POINTS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  List up to three key points (at least one is required)
%  Key Points summarize the main points and conclusions of the article
%  Each must be 140 characters or fewer with no special characters or punctuation and must be complete sentences

% Example:
% \begin{keypoints}
% \item	List up to three key points (at least one is required)
% \item	Key Points summarize the main points and conclusions of the article
% \item	Each must be 140 characters or fewer with no special characters or punctuation and must be complete sentences

%
%  ABSTRACT and PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY
%
% A good Abstract will begin with a short description of the problem
% being addressed, briefly describe the new data or analyses, then
% briefly states the main conclusion(s) and how they are supported and
% uncertainties.

% The Plain Language Summary should be written for a broad audience,
% including journalists and the science-interested public, that will not have 
% a background in your field.
%
% A Plain Language Summary is required in GRL, JGR: Planets, JGR: Biogeosciences,
% JGR: Oceans, G-Cubed, Reviews of Geophysics, and JAMES.

%  BODY TEXT
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% Suggested section heads:
% \section{Introduction}
%
% The main text should start with an introduction. Except for short
% manuscripts (such as comments and replies), the text should be divided
% into sections, each with its own heading.

% Headings should be sentence fragments and do not begin with a
% lowercase letter or number. Examples of good headings are:

% \section{Materials and Methods}
% Here is text on Materials and Methods.
%
% \subsection{A descriptive heading about methods}
% More about Methods.
%
% \section{Data} (Or section title might be a descriptive heading about data)
%
% \section{Results} (Or section title might be a descriptive heading about the
% results)
%
% \section{Conclusions}

%  Numbered lines in equations:
%  To add line numbers to lines in equations,
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
%  \end{equation}
%  \end{linenomath*}



%% Enter Figures and Tables near as possible to where they are first mentioned:
%
% DO NOT USE \psfrag or \subfigure commands.
%
% Figure captions go below the figure.
% Acronyms used in figure captions will be spelled out in the final, published version.

% Table titles go above tables;  other caption information
%  should be placed in last line of the table, using
% \multicolumn2l{$^a$ This is a table note.}
% NOTE that there is no difference between table caption and table heading in the final, published version
%
%----------------
% EXAMPLE FIGURES
%
% \begin{figure}
% \includegraphics{example.png}
% \caption{caption}
% \end{figure}
%
% Giving latex a width will help it to scale the figure properly. A simple trick is to use \textwidth. Try this if large figures run off the side of the page.
% \begin{figure}
% \noindent\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{anothersample.png}
%\caption{caption}
%\label{pngfiguresample}
%\end{figure}
%
%
% If you get an error about an unknown bounding box, try specifying the width and height of the figure with the natwidth and natheight options. This is common when trying to add a PDF figure without pdflatex.
% \begin{figure}
% \noindent\includegraphics[natwidth=800px,natheight=600px]{samplefigure.pdf}
%\caption{caption}
%\label{pdffiguresample}
%\end{figure}
%
%
% PDFLatex does not seem to be able to process EPS figures. You may want to try the epstopdf package.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  SECTION HEADS
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for
% prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
% three or fewer letters).

% AGU follows standard outline style; therefore, there cannot be a section 1 without
% a section 2, or a section 2.3.1 without a section 2.3.2.
% Please make sure your section numbers are balanced.
% ---------------
% Level 1 head
%
% Use the \section{} command to identify level 1 heads;
% type the appropriate head wording between the curly
% brackets, as shown below.
%
%An example:
%\section{Level 1 Head: Introduction}
%
% ---------------
% Level 2 head
%
% Use the \subsection{} command to identify level 2 heads.
%An example:
%\subsection{Level 2 Head}
%
% ---------------
% Level 3 head
%
% Use the \subsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
%An example:
%\subsubsection{Level 3 Head}
%
%---------------
% Level 4 head
%
% Use the \subsubsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
% An example:
%\subsubsubsection{Level 4 Head} An example.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  IN-TEXT LISTS
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Do not use bulleted lists; enumerated lists are okay.
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item
% \item
% \item
% \end{enumerate}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  EQUATIONS
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}


% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
%  \end{equation}
%  \end{linenomath*}
