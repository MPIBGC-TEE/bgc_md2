  abstract =      {We propose here a general mathematical framework to
                   represent soil organic matter dynamics. This
                   framework is expressed in the language of dynamical
                   systems and generalizes previous modeling approaches.
                   It is based on a set of six basic principles about
                   the decomposition of soil organic matter: 1) mass
                   balance, 2) substrate dependence of decomposition, 3)
                   heterogeneity of the speed of decay, 4) internal
                   transformations of organic matter, 5) environmental
                   variability effects, and 6) substrate interactions.
                   We show how the majority of models previously
                   proposed are special cases of this general model.
                   This approach provides tools to classify models
                   according to the main principles or concepts they
                   include. It also helps to identify a priori the
                   general behavior of different models or groups of
                   models. Another important characteristic of the
                   proposed mathematical representation is the
                   possibility to develop particular models at any level
                   of detail. This characteristic is described as a
                   modeling hierarchy, in which a general model of a
                   high degree of abstraction can accommodate specific
                   realizations of model structure for specific modeling
                   objectives. This framework also allows us to study
                   general properties of groups of models such as their
                   qualitative behavior, time-scale of application, and
                   their dynamic stability. For instance, we find
                   conditions under which models are asymptotically
                   stable, i.e. converge to a stable steady-state in the
                   long-term, but may approach this state with or
                   without oscillations. We also expand the concept of
                   dynamic stability for models that include
                   time-dependencies and do not converge to a fixed
                   steady-state, but rather to a region of stability in
                   the state-space. As an example of the application of
                   the concept of dynamic stability, we show how this
                   framework helps to explain the acclimation of soil
                   respiration fluxes in soil warming experiments.},

                   particles to transit a compartmental system? What is
                   the age distribution of particles in the system?
                   These questions are important to understand the
                   dynamics of modeled processes in many scientific
                   fields. Until now, they could be answered only for
                   systems in steady state, but the steady-state
                   assumption is very restrictive and almost always
                   unreasonable. Nonlinear relations between
                   compartments and changing environmental factors keep
                   systems permanently changing. A theory is presented
                   here to describe the time evolution of age densities
                   under changing environmental influences in nonlinear
                   systems. An application is provided, addressing
                   questions of high scientific and societal interest
                   such as the lifetime of fossil fuel-derived
                   atmospheric carbon.Many processes in nature are
                   modeled using compartmental systems
                   (reservoir/pool/box systems). Usually, they are
                   expressed as a set of first-order differential
                   equations describing the transfer of matter across a
                   network of compartments. The concepts of age of
                   matter in compartments and the time required for
                   particles to transit the system are important
                   diagnostics of these models with applications to a
                   wide range of scientific questions. Until now,
                   explicit formulas for transit-time and age
                   distributions of nonlinear time-dependent
                   compartmental systems were not available. We compute
                   densities for these types of systems under the
                   assumption of well-mixed compartments. Assuming that
                   a solution of the nonlinear system is available at
                   least numerically, we show how to construct a linear
                   time-dependent system with the same solution
                   trajectory. We demonstrate how to exploit this
                   solution to compute transit-time and age
                   distributions in dependence on given start values and
                   initial age distributions. Furthermore, we derive
                   equations for the time evolution of quantiles and
                   moments of the age distributions. Our results
                   generalize available density formulas for the linear
                   time-independent case and mean-age formulas for the
                   linear time-dependent case. As an example, we apply
                   our formulas to a nonlinear and a linear version of a
                   simple global carbon cycle model driven by a
                   time-dependent input signal which represents fossil
                   fuel additions. We derive time-dependent age
                   distributions for all compartments and calculate the
                   time it takes to remove fossil carbon in a
                   business-as-usual scenario.},
