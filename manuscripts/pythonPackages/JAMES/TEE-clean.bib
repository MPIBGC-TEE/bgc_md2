@phdthesis{Herrera,
	abstract = {Trees use nonstructural carbon (NSC) to run their metabolism. They absorb carbon through photosynthesis and store it as NSC. Storage of nonstructural carbon (NSC) in different organs buffer metabolic demands when photosynthesis is limited, which helps trees to cope with these stressful conditions. These conditions are recurrent throughout trees lifetime and they can reduce photosynthesis. These stressful conditions are increasing with climate change, which impose risks of widespread loss of trees and ecosystem functions around the world. Therefore, it is essential to understand how the storage of NSC in trees contributes to trees{\&}{\#}39; survival to stressful conditions. Nevertheless, for tropical trees it is unknown how they would respond to an increase in stressful conditions and how storage of NSC would contribute to tree survival and resilience. For instance, NSC storage capacity and its spatial distribution in wood may be related with the accessibility and cycling of this carbon reserves, they may impact the time that carbon resides in trees and they may vary between tropical trees with different functional traits. To test this assumption, here we wanted to evaluate the storage capacity, and the spatial and temporal distribution of NSC in tropical trees from a seasonally dry forest in the Amazon in relation to their wood anatomical traits, leaf habit (evergreen and semi deciduous) and life history traits (growth and mortality rates). This dissertation addresses the following question: what are the principal factors that influence the dynamics of allocation and use of NSC storage in the stem wood of some tropical tree species, and how to model these NSC dynamics in order to predict NSC ages and transit times under stressful conditions. These questions were addressed within the three main chapters of this thesis, which are described below.},

	abstract = {Los estudios sobre la asignaci{\'o}n del carbono en los ecosistemas forestales proporcionan informaci{\'o}n esencial para la comprensi{\'o}n de las diferencias espaciales y temporales en el ciclo del carbono de tal forma que pueden aportar informaci{\'o}n a los modelos y, as{\'\i} predecir las posibles respuestas de los bosques a los cambios en el clima. Dentro de este contexto, los bosques Amaz{\'o}nicos desempe{\~n}an un papel particularmente importante en el balance global del carbono; no obstante, existen grandes incertidumbres en cuanto a los controles abi{\'o}ticos en las tasas de la producci{\'o}n primaria neta (PPN), la asignaci{\'o}n de los productos de la fotos{\'\i}ntesis a los diferentes componentes o compartimentos del ecosistema (a{\'e}reo y subterr{\'a}neo) y, c{\'o}mo estos componentes de la asignaci{\'o}n del carbono responden a eventos clim{\'a}ticos extremos. El objetivo general de esta tesis es analizar los componentes de la asignaci{\'o}n del carbono en bosques tropicales maduros sobre suelos contrastantes, que crecen bajo condiciones clim{\'a}ticas similares en dos sitios ubicados en la Amazonia noroccidental (Colombia): el Parque Natural Nacional Amacayacu y la Estaci{\'o}n Biol{\'o}gica Zafire. Con este objetivo, realic{\'e} mediciones de los componentes de la asignaci{\'o}n del carbono (biomasa, productividad primaria neta, y su fraccionamiento) a nivel ecosist{\'e}mico y de la din{\'a}mica forestal (tasas anuales de mortalidad y reclutamiento), a lo largo de ocho a{\~n}os (2004?2012) en seis parcelas permanentes de 1 hect{\'a}rea establecidas en cinco tipos de bosques sobre suelos diferentes (arcilloso, franco-arcilloso, franco-arcilloso-arenoso, franco-arenoso y arena-francosa). Toda esta informaci{\'o}n me permiti{\'o} abordar preguntas espec{\'\i}ficas que detallo a continuaci{\'o}n. En el Cap{\'\i}tulo 2 eval{\'u}e la hip{\'o}tesis de que a medida que aumenta la fertilidad del suelo disminuye la cantidad del carbono asignado a la producci{\'o}n subterr{\'a}nea (ra{\'\i}ces finas con di{\'a}metro {\ensuremath{<}}2 mm). Y para esto, realic{\'e} mediciones de la masa y la producci{\'o}n de ra{\'\i}ces finas usando dos m{\'e}todos: (1) el de los cilindros de crecimiento y, (2) el de los cilindros de extracci{\'o}n secuencial. El monitoreo se realiz{\'o} durante 2.2 a{\~n}os en los bosques con suelos m{\'a}s contrastantes: arcilla y arena-francosa. Encontr{\'e} diferencias significativas en la masa de ra{\'\i}ces finas y su producci{\'o}n entre los bosques y, tambi{\'e}n con respecto a la profundidad del suelo (0?10 y 10?20 cm). El bosque sobre arena-francosa asign{\'o} m{\'a}s carbono a las ra{\'\i}ces finas que el bosque sobre arcillas. La producci{\'o}n de ra{\'\i}ces finas en el bosque sobre arena-francosa fue dos veces m{\'a}s alta (media {$\pm$} error est{\'a}ndar = 2.98 {$\pm$} 0.36 y 3.33 {$\pm$} 0.69 Mg C ha?1 a{\~n}o?1, con el m{\'e}todo 1 y 2, respectivamente), que para el bosque sobre arcillas, el suelo m{\'a}s f{\'e}rtil (1.51 {$\pm$} 0.14, m{\'e}todo 1, y desde 1.03 {$\pm$} 0.31 a 1.36 {$\pm$} 0.23 Mg C ha?1 a{\~n}o?1, m{\'e}todo 2). Del mismo modo, el promedio de la masa de ra{\'\i}ces finas fue tres veces mayor en el bosque sobre arena-francosa (5.47 {$\pm$} 0.17 Mg C ha?1) que en el suelo m{\'a}s f{\'e}rtil (de 1.52 {$\pm$} 0.08 a 1.82 {$\pm$} 0.09 Mg C ha?1). La masa de las ra{\'\i}ces finas tambi{\'e}n mostr{\'o} un patr{\'o}n temporal relacionado con la lluvia, mostrando que la producci{\'o}n de ra{\'\i}ces finas disminuy{\'o} sustancialmente en el per{\'\i}odo seco del a{\~n}o 2005. Estos resultados sugieren que los recursos del suelo pueden desempe{\~n}ar un papel importante en los patrones de la asignaci{\'o}n del carbono entre los componentes a{\'e}reo y subterr{\'a}neo de los bosques tropicales; y que el suelo no s{\'o}lo influye en las diferencias en la masa de ra{\'\i}ces finas y su producci{\'o}n, sino que tambi{\'e}n, en conjunto con la lluvia, sobre la estacionalidad de la producci{\'o}n. En el Cap{\'\i}tulo 3 estim{\'e} y analic{\'e} los tres componentes de la asignaci{\'o}n del carbono a nivel del ecosistema: la biomasa, la productividad primaria neta ?PPN, y su fraccionamiento, en los mismos bosques del Cap{\'\i}tulo 2 (el bosque sobre arcillas y el bosque sobre arena-francosa). Encontr{\'e} diferencias significativas en los patrones de la asignaci{\'o}n del carbono entre los bosques; el bosque sobre arcillas present{\'o} una mayor biomasa total y a{\'e}rea, as{\'\i} como una PPN, que el bosque sobre arena-francosa. Sin embargo, la diferencia entre los dos bosques en t{\'e}rminos de la productividad primaria neta total fue menor en comparaci{\'o}n con las diferencias entre la biomasa total de los bosques, como consecuencia de las diferentes estrategias en la asignaci{\'o}n del carbono a los componentes a{\'e}reo y subterr{\'a}neo del bosque. La proporci{\'o}n o fracci{\'o}n de la PPN asignada a la nueva producci{\'o}n de follaje fue relativamente similar entre los dos bosques. Nuestros resultados de los incrementos de la biomasa a{\'e}rea sugieren una posible compensaci{\'o}n entre la asignaci{\'o}n del carbono al crecimiento de las ra{\'\i}ces finas versus el de la madera, a diferencia de la compensaci{\'o}n com{\'u}nmente asumida entre la parte a{\'e}rea y la subterr{\'a}nea en general. A pesar de estas diferencias entre los bosques en t{\'e}rminos de los componentes de la asignaci{\'o}n del carbono, el {\'\i}ndice de {\'a}rea foliar fue relativamente similar entre ellos, lo que sugiere que el {\'\i}ndice de {\'a}rea foliar es m{\'a}s un indicador de la PPN total que de la asignaci{\'o}n de carbono entre componentes. En el Cap{\'\i}tulo 4 evalu{\'e} la variaci{\'o}n espacial y temporal de los componentes de la asignaci{\'o}n del carbono y la din{\'a}mica forestal de cinco tipos e bosques amaz{\'o}nicos y sus respuestas a fluctuaciones en la precipitaci{\'o}n, lo cual es completamente relevante en el ciclo global del carbono y los procesos biogeoqu{\'\i}micos en general. Estas variaciones son as{\'\i} mismo importantes para evaluar los efectos de la sequ{\'\i}a o eventos extremos sobre la din{\'a}mica natural de los bosques amaz{\'o}nicos. Evalu{\'e} la variaci{\'o}n interanual y la estacionalidad de los componentes de la asignaci{\'o}n del carbono y la din{\'a}mica forestal durante el periodo 2004?2012, en cinco bosques maduros sobre diferentes suelos (arcilloso, franco-arcilloso, franco-arcilloso-arenoso, franco-arenoso y arena-francosa), todos bajo el mismo r{\'e}gimen local de precipitaci{\'o}n en la Amazonia noroccidental (Colombia). Quer{\'\i}a examinar s{\'\i} estos bosques responden de forma similar a las fluctuaciones en la precipitaci{\'o}n, tal y como pronostican muchos modelos. Consider{\'e} las siguientes preguntas: (i) ?Existe una correlaci{\'o}n entre los componentes de la asignaci{\'o}n del carbono y la din{\'a}mica forestal con la precipitaci{\'o}n? (ii) ?Existe correlaci{\'o}n entre los bosques? (iii) ?Es el {\'\i}ndice de {\'a}rea foliar (LAI) un indicador de las variaciones en la producci{\'o}n a{\'e}rea o es un reflejo de los cambios en los patrones de la asignaci{\'o}n del carbono entre bosques?. En general, la correlaci{\'o}n entre los componentes a{\'e}reo y subterr{\'a}neo de la asignaci{\'o}n del carbono con la precipitaci{\'o}n sugiere que los suelos juegan un papel importante en las diferencias espaciales y temporales de las respuestas de estos bosques a las variaciones en la precipitaci{\'o}n. Por un lado, la mayor{\'\i}a de los bosques mostraron que los componentes a{\'e}reos de la asignaci{\'o}n del carbono son susceptibles a las fluctuaciones en la precipitaci{\'o}n; sin embargo, el bosque sobre arena-francosa solamente present{\'o} correlaci{\'o}n con la lluvia con el componente subterr{\'a}neo (ra{\'\i}ces finas). Por otra parte, a pesar de que el noroeste Amaz{\'o}nico es considerado sin una estaci{\'o}n seca propiamente (definida como {\ensuremath{<}}100 mm meses ?1), la hojarasca y la masa de ra{\'\i}ces finas mostraron una alta variabilidad y estacionalidad, especialmente marcada durante la sequ{\'\i}a del 2005. Adem{\'a}s, los bosques del grupo de suelos francos mostraron que la hojarasca responde a retrasos en la precipitaci{\'o}n, al igual que la masa de ra{\'\i}ces finas del bosque sobre arena-francosa. En cuanto a la din{\'a}mica forestal, s{\'o}lo la tasa de mortalidad del bosque sobre arena-francosa estuvo correlacionada con la precipitaci{\'o}n ({\ensuremath{\rho}} = 0.77, P {\ensuremath{<}}0.1). La variabilidad interanual en los incrementos en el tallo y la biomasa de los individuos resalta la importancia de la mortalidad en la variaci{\'o}n de los incrementos en la biomasa a{\'e}rea. Sin embargo, las tasas de mortalidad y las proporciones de individuos muertos por categor{\'\i}a de muerte (en pie, ca{\'\i}do de ra{\'\i}z, partido y desaparecido), no mostraron tendencias claras relacionadas con la sequ{\'\i}a. Curiosamente, la hojarasca, el incremento en la biomasa a{\'e}rea y las tasas de reclutamiento mostraron una alta correlaci{\'o}n entre los bosques, en particular dentro del grupo de los bosques con suelos francos. Sin embargo, el {\'\i}ndice de {\'a}rea foliar estimado para los bosques con suelos m{\'a}s contrastantes (arcilla y arena-francosa), no present{\'o} correlaci{\'o}n significativa con la lluvia; no obstante, estuvo muy correlacionado entre bosques; {\'\i}ndice de {\'a}rea foliar no reflej{\'o} las diferencias en la asignaci{\'o}n de los componentes del carbono, y su respuesta a la precipitaci{\'o}n en estos bosques. Por {\'u}ltimo, los bosques estudiados muestran que el noroeste amaz{\'o}nico es susceptible a fen{\'o}menos clim{\'a}ticos, contrario a lo propuesto anteriormente debido a la ausencia de una estaci{\'o}n seca propiamente dicha.   ABSTRACT Studies of carbon allocation in forests provide essential information for understanding spatial and temporal differences in carbon cycling that can inform models and predict possible responses to changes in climate. Amazon forests play a particularly significant role in the global carbon balance, but there are still large uncertainties regarding abiotic controls on the rates of net primary production (NPP) and the allocation of photosynthetic products to different ecosystem components; and how the carbon allocation components of Amazon forests respond to extreme climate events. The overall objective of this thesis is to examine the carbon allocation components in old-growth tropical forests on contrasting soils, and under similar climatic conditions in two sites at the Amacayacu National Natural Park and the Zafire Biological Station, located in the north-western Amazon (Colombia). Measurements of above- and below-ground carbon allocation components (biomass, net primary production, and its partitioning) at the ecosystem level, and dynamics of tree mortality and recruitment were done along eight years (2004?2012) in six 1-ha plots established in five Amazon forest types on different soils (clay, clay-loam, sandy-clay-loam, sandy-loam and loamy-sand) to address specific questions detailed in the next paragraphs. In Chapter 2, I evaluated the hypothesis that as soil fertility increases the amount of carbon allocated to below-ground production (fine-roots) should decrease. To address this hypothesis the standing crop mass and production of fine-roots ({\ensuremath{<}}2 mm) were estimated by two methods: (1) ingrowth cores and, (2) sequential soil coring, during 2.2 years in the most contrasting forests: the clay-soil forest and the loamy-sand forest. We found that the standing crop fine-root mass and its production were significantly different between forests and also between soil depths (0?10 and 10?20 cm). The loamysand forest allocated more carbon to fine-roots than the clay-soil forest, with fine-root production in the loamy-sand forest twice (mean {$\pm$} standard error = 2.98 {$\pm$} 0.36 and 3.33 {$\pm$} 0.69 Mg C ha ?1 yr ?1, method 1 and 2, respectively) as much as for the more fertile claysoil forest (1.51 {$\pm$} 0.14, method 1, and from 1.03 {$\pm$} 0.31 to 1.36 {$\pm$} 0.23 Mg C ha ?1 yr ?1, method 2). Similarly, the average of standing crop fine-root mass was three times higher in the loamy-sand forest (5.47 {$\pm$} 0.17 Mg C ha?1) than in the more fertile soil (from 1.52 {$\pm$} 0.08 a 1.82 {$\pm$} 0.09 Mg C ha?1). The standing crop fine-root mass also showed a temporal pattern related to rainfall, with the production of fine-roots decreasing substantially in the dry period of the year 2005. These results suggest that soil resources may play an important role in patterns of carbon allocation of below-ground components, not only driven the differences in the biomass and its production, but also in the time when it is produced. In Chapter 3, I assessed the three components of stand-level carbon allocation (biomass, NPP, and its partitioning) for the same forests evaluated in Chapter 2 (clay-soil forest and loamy-sand forest). We found differences in carbon allocation patterns between these two forests, showing that the forest on clay-soil had a higher aboveground and total biomass as well as a higher above-ground NPP than the loamy-sand forest. However, differences between the two types of forests in terms of stand-level NPP were smaller, as a consequence of different strategies in the carbon allocation of above- and below-ground components. The proportional allocation of NPP to new foliage production was relatively similar between the two forests. Our results of aboveground biomass increments and fine-root production suggest a possible trade-off between carbon allocation to fine-roots versus wood growth (as it has been reported by other authors), as opposed to the most commonly assumed trade-off between total above- and below-ground production. Despite these differences among forests in terms of carbon allocation components, the leaf area index showed differences between forests like total NPP, suggesting that the leaf area index is more indicative of total NPP than carbon allocation. In Chapter 4, I evaluated the spatial and temporal variation of carbon allocation components and forest dynamics of Amazon forests as well as their responses to climatic fluctuations. I evaluated the intra- and inter-annual variation of carbon allocation components and forest dynamics during the period 2004?2012 in five forests on different soils (clay, clay-loam, sandy-clay-loam, sandy-loam and loamy-sand), but growing under the same local precipitation regime in north-western Amazonia (Colombia). We were interested in examining if these forests respond similarly to rainfall fluctuations as many models predict, considering the following questions: (i) Is there a correlation in carbon allocation components and forest dynamics with precipitation? (ii) Is there a correlation among forests? (iii) Are temporal responses in leaf area index (LAI) indicative of variations of above-ground production or a reflection of changes in carbon allocation patterns among forests?. Overall, the correlation of above- and below-ground carbon allocation components with rainfall suggests that soils play an important role in the spatial and temporal differences of responses of these forests to rainfall fluctuations. On the one hand, most forests showed that the above-ground components are susceptible to rainfall fluctuations; however, there was a forest on loamy-sand that only showed a correlation with the below-ground component (fine-roots). On the other hand, despite the fact that north-western Amazonia is considered without a conspicuous dry season (defined as {\ensuremath{<}}100 mm month?1), litterfall and fine-root mass showed high seasonality and variability, particularly marked during the drought of 2005. Additionally, forests of the loam-soil group showed that litterfall respond to time-lags in rainfall as well as and the fine-root mass of the loamy-sand forest. With regard to forest dynamics, only the mortality rate of the loamy-sand forest was significantly correlated with rainfall (77\%). The observed inter-annual variability of stem and biomass increments of individuals highlighted the importance of the mortality in the above-ground biomass increment. However, mortality rates and death type proportion did not show clear trends related to droughts. Interestingly, litterfall, above-ground biomass increment and recruitment rates of forests showed high correlation among forests, particularly within the loam-soil forests group. Nonetheless, LAI measured in the most contrasting forests (clay-soil and loamysand) was poorly correlated with rainfall but highly correlated between forests; LAI did not reflect the differences in the carbon allocation components, and their response to rainfall on these forests. Finally, the forests studied highlight that north-western Amazon forests are also susceptible to climate fluctuations, contrary to what has been proposed previously due to their lack of a pronounced dry season.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to understand how eight decades of tillage affected soil element dynamics. We measured soil chemical properties and the 14C:12C ratio (Δ14C) of organic carbon in one of the oldest cropland experiments in Europe with different levels of phosphorus addition. Soil total and organic phosphorus stocks in the uppermost 20 cm did not differ significantly between the control and the phosphorus addition treatments after 80 years, indicating plant phosphorus uptake from the subsoil. Crop yields increased from 220 g dry weight m−2 in 1936 to more than 500 g dry weight m−2 in the 2010s. The soil total organic carbon and total organic phosphorus stocks decreased by 13.7{\%} and 11.6{\%}, respectively, in the uppermost 20 cm of the soils during the experiment, irrespective of phosphorus addition. Based on modeling of Δ14C, we show that the mean transit time of carbon in the soil was below 10 years, indicating that a large share of the carbon inputs to soil is quickly respired. Our results suggest that the current agricultural practice at this long-term experiment is not sustainable because it led to a continuous decrease in soil organic matter over the last decades, despite increases in plant productivity.},

	abstract = {Abstract Climate projection requires an accurate understanding for soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition and its response to warming. An emergent view considers that environmental constraints rather than chemical structure alone control SOC turnover and its temperature sensitivity (i.e., Q10), but direct long-term evidence is lacking. Here, using compound-specific radiocarbon analysis of soil profiles along a 3300-km grassland transect, we provide direct evidence for the rapid turnover of lignin-derived phenols compared with slower-cycling molecular components of SOC (i.e., long-chain lipids and black carbon). Furthermore, in contrast to the slow-cycling components whose turnover is strongly modulated by mineral association and exhibits low Q10, lignin turnover is mainly regulated by temperature and has a high Q10. Such contrasts resemble those between fast-cycling (i.e., light) and mineral-associated slow-cycling fractions from globally distributed soils. Collectively, our results suggest that warming may greatly accelerate the decomposition of lignin, especially in soils with relatively weak mineral associations.},

@article{Giraldo2023,
	abstract = {Abstract The occurrence of annual growth rings in tropical trees---the result of the seasonal activity of vascular cambium---has been explained by seasonal water deficit or flooding periods. However, little is known about the drivers of annual tree-ring formation under tropical hyper-humid conditions without clear seasonal dry periods or flooding (ever-wet conditions). Shelford's law states that the deficit or the excess of environmental resources limits plant growth. Accordingly, we hypothesize that excess soil moisture, a slight seasonal reduction of precipitation and a reduction in light availability determine rhythmic growth in ever-wet tropical forests. We first assessed the occurrence of rhythmic growth in 14 tree species from the Biogeographic Choc{\'o} Region (annual rainfall 7200 mm) using three methods: Radiocarbon (14C) dating (all studied species), tree-ring synchronization (4 species that have replicates) and automatic dendrometers (two species). Then, we assessed the effect of environmental drivers (rainfall, short-wave radiation, temperature and soil moisture) on tree growth based on tree ring and dendrometer observations. We present evidence of annual tree-ring formation in all 14 studied tree species. Depending on the tree species, we observed positive and negative correlations between growth, water availability and light availability. These relationships suggest that both excess or deficit of environmental resources may explain the seasonal pattern of tree growth. Although we cannot differentiate between excess soil water and low light availability by high cloudiness, we suggest that cloudiness frequency could affect tree growth in these forests. Synthesis. We reveal the annual formation of growth rings in the unexplored wetter-end tropical forests, where seasonal growth depends on either high soil moisture and hypoxia or light limitations by cloudiness and photosynthesis constraints.},

	abstract = {Predicting soil organic carbon (SOC) is problematic in tropical soils because mechanisms of SOC (de)stabilization are not resolved. We aimed to identify such storage mechanisms in a tropical soil landscape constrained by 100 years of similar soil inputs and agricultural disturbance under the production of sugarcane, a C4 grass and bioenergy feedstock. We measured soil physicochemical parameters, SOC concentration, and SOC dynamics by soil horizon to one meter to identify soil parameters that can predict SOC outcomes. Applying correlative analyses, linear mixed model (LMM) regression, model selection by AICc, and hierarchical clustering we found that slow moving SOC was related to many soil parameters, while the fastest moving SOC was only related to soil surface charge. Our models explained 78--79{\%}, 51--57{\%}, 7--8{\%} of variance in SOC concentration, slow pool decay, and fast pool decay, respectively. Top SOC predictors were roots, the ratio of organo-complexed iron (Fe) to aluminum (Al), water stable aggregates (WSagg), and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Using hierarchical clustering we also assessed SOC predictors across gradients of depth and rainfall with strong reductions in Roots, SOC, and slow pool decay associated with increasing depth, while increased rainfall was associated with increased Clay and WSagg and reduced CEC in surface soils. Increased negative surface charge, water stable aggregation, organo-Fe complexation, and root inputs were key SOC protection mechanisms despite high soil disturbance. Further development of these relationships is expected to improve understanding of SOC storage mechanisms and outcomes in similar tropical agricultural soils globally.},

	abstract = {Abstract Land ecosystems contribute to climate change mitigation by taking up approximately 30\% of anthropogenically emitted carbon. However, estimates of the amount and distribution of carbon uptake across the world's ecosystems or biomes display great uncertainty. The latter hinders a full understanding of the mechanisms and drivers of land carbon uptake, and predictions of the future fate of the land carbon sink. The latter is needed as evidence to inform climate mitigation strategies such as afforestation schemes. To advance land carbon cycle modeling, we have developed a matrix approach. Land carbon cycle models use carbon balance equations to represent carbon exchanges among pools. Our approach organizes this set of equations into a single matrix equation without altering any processes of the original model. The matrix equation enables the development of a theoretical framework for understanding the general, transient behavior of the land carbon cycle. While carbon input and residence time are used to quantify carbon storage capacity at steady state, a third quantity, carbon storage potential, integrates fluxes with time to define dynamic disequilibrium of the carbon cycle under global change. The matrix approach can help address critical contemporary issues in modeling, including pinpointing sources of model uncertainty and accelerating spin-up of land carbon cycle models by tens of times. The accelerated spin-up liberates models from the computational burden that hinders comprehensive parameter sensitivity analysis and assimilation of observational data to improve model accuracy. Such computational efficiency offered by the matrix approach enables substantial improvement of model predictions using ever-increasing data availability. Overall, the matrix approach offers a step change forward for understanding and modeling the land carbon cycle.},

@article{Xiao2022,
	abstract = {Abstract Abstract Soil carbon (C) is comprised of a continuum of organic compounds with distinct ages (i.e., the time a C atom has experienced in soil since the C atom entered soil). The contribution of different age groups to soil C efflux is critical for understanding soil C stability and persistence, but is poorly understood due to the complexity of soil C pool age structure and potential distinct turnover behaviors of age groups. Here we build upon quantification of soil C transit times to infer the age of C atoms in soil C efflux (aefflux) from seven sequential soil layer depths down to 2 m at a global scale, and compare this age with radiocarbon-inferred ages of C retained in corresponding soil layers (asoil). In the whole 0--2 m soil profile, the mean aefflux is 194211021 (mean with 5--95\% quantiles) yr, and is just about one-eighth of asoil (14767172547 yr), demonstrating that younger C dominates soil C efflux. With increasing soil depth, both aefflux and asoil are increased, but their disparities are markedly narrowed. That is, the proportional contribution of relatively younger soil C to efflux is decreased in deeper layers, demonstrating that C inputs (new and young) stay longer in deeper layers. Across the globe, we find large spatial variability of the contribution of soil C age groups to C efflux. Especially, in deep soil layers of cold regions (e.g., boreal forests and tundra), aefflux may be older than asoil, suggesting that older C dominates C efflux only under a limited range of conditions. These results imply that most C inputs may not contribute to long-term soil C storage, particularly in upper layers that hold the majority of new C inputs.},

	abstract = {In democracies around the world, societies have demonstrated that elections can have major consequences for the environment. In Colombia, the 2022 presidential elections will take place at a time when progress towards peace has stalled and socioeconomic, security, and environmental conditions have deteriorated. The recent declines in these conditions largely coincide with the change of government after the 2018 elections, and the associated rise to power of a party that boycotted the peace negotiations from the beginning. These indicators suggest that 2018 marked the end of a decade of improvements in safety, wealth, and equality---societal factors that can interact with the environment in multiple ways. A spike in assassinations of land and environmental defenders in 2019 and 2020 made Colombia one of the most dangerous places in the world for environmentalists. With the 2022 presidential election, Colombians will once again decide who will govern the country and what new social, economic, and environmental policies will be implemented. In preparation for elections like this, we believe that it is important for scientists with relevant backgrounds to highlight relationships between political events and the environment, to enrich the political debate, help prioritize public resources, and inform policy-making. Here, we provide a multidisciplinary analysis of different socioeconomic and environmental trends that can help inform the public and decision-makers. We intend for this analysis to be useful not only in Colombia, but also to other societies under similar situations, managing biodiversity-rich ecosystems in socio-political environments of increasing violence, poverty, and inequality.},

@incollection{Riley2022,
	abstract = {Summary Soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics emerge from ecological, physical, and biogeochemical interactions between soils and plants. Many models applied in Site- to global-scale studies represent SOM evolution using a cascade of pools that decay in a pseudo-first-order manner without explicit account of SOM's dependence on the ecological interactions among biological organisms and relevant abiotic processes. This lack of mechanistic realism makes these models unable to capture important short-term responses to changing inputs (e.g. priming) or, perhaps, long-term and large spatial scale responses under a changing climate (e.g. temperature sensitivity of mineral--surface protection and interactions, microbial responses to soil moisture variability). To address these issues, a new generation of soil biogeochemical models are being developed which more explicitly represent the various processes of eco-biogeochemistry, including microbial physiology and community structure, abiotic interactions, soil structure, vertical transport, erosion, redox controls, and interactions with plants. However, because of the complexity of interactions now being represented in these models (multi-species, multi-phase, multi-competitor, multi-transport-pathway, vertically resolved), much more sophisticated numerical methods for temporal and spatial integration are required. We therefore introduce and describe an open-source SOM ``model farm'' (BeTR-S; https://github.com/BeTR-biogeochemistry-modeling/sbetr ) which allows for a wide range of process representations that can easily be manipulated and solved with robust open-source numerical solvers. Our goals here include (i) presenting a SOM model structure for BeTR-S that can ``mechanistically'' represent dominant processes and is applicable to site-level (~o(100 m 2 ) horizontally and ~o(1--10 cm) vertically) representation; (ii) describing approaches to benchmark and analyze model components and emergent responses; and (iii) discussing uncertainties associated with process representations and numerics. Our hope is that this type of model structure can be used as a unit module for one-dimensional SOM analyses and can be integrated in three-dimensional models that consider lateral mass and energy exchanges, thereby facilitating landscape-scale SOM representation and spatial scaling analyses. Finally, we hope that this open resource will lower the cost of entry for scientists interested in evaluating a wide range of hypotheses relevant to SOM dynamics.},

	abstract = {To meet international and national commitments to decrease emissions of fossil fuels, cities around the world must obtain information on their historical levels of emissions, identifying hotspots that require special attention. Direct atmospheric measurements of pollution sources are almost impossible to obtain retrospectively. However, tree rings serve as an archive of environmental information for reconstructing the temporal and spatial distribution of fossil-fuel emissions in urban areas. Here, we present a novel methodology to reconstruct the spatial and temporal contribution of fossil-fuel CO2 concentration ([CO2F]) in the urban area of Medellin, Colombia. We used a combination of dendrochronological analyses, radiocarbon measurements, and statistical modeling. We obtained annual maps of [CO2F] from 1977 to 2018 that describe changes in its spatial distribution over time. Our method was successful at identifying hotspots of emissions around industrial areas, and areas with high traffic density. It also identified temporal trends that may be related to socioeconomic and technological factors. We observed an important increase in [CO2F] during the last decade, which suggests that efforts of city officials to reduce traffic and emissions did not have a significant impact on the contribution of fossil fuels to local air. The method presented here could be of significant value for city planners and environmental officials from other urban areas around the world. It allows identifying hotspots of fossil fuels emissions, evaluating the impact of previous environmental policies, and planning new interventions to reduce emissions.},

However such studies mostly emphasize the mean value (as Δ14C) of an unknown probability distribution. We introduce a novel algorithm to compute Δ14C distributions from knowledge of the age distribution of carbon in linear compartmental systems at steady-state. Our results demonstrate that the shape of the distributions might differ according to the speed of cycling of ecosystem compartments and their connectivity within the system, and might contain multiple peaks and long tails. The distributions are also sensitive to the variations of Δ14C in the atmosphere over time, as influenced by the counteracting anthropogenic effects of fossil-fuel emissions (14C-free) and nuclear weapons testing (excess 14C). Lastly, we discuss insights that such distributions can offer for sampling and design of experiments aiming to capture the precise variance of Δ14C values present in the multi-compartmental ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Abstract Understanding the controls on the amount and persistence of soil organic carbon (C) is essential for predicting its sensitivity to global change. The response may depend on whether C is unprotected, isolated within aggregates, or protected from decomposition by mineral associations. Here, we present a global synthesis of the relative influence of environmental factors on soil organic C partitioning among pools, abundance in each pool (mg C g−1 soil), and persistence (as approximated by radiocarbon abundance) in relatively unprotected particulate and protected mineral-bound pools. We show that C within particulate and mineral-associated pools consistently differed from one another in degree of persistence and relationship to environmental factors. Soil depth was the best predictor of C abundance and persistence, though it accounted for more variance in persistence. Persistence of all C pools decreased with increasing mean annual temperature (MAT) throughout the soil profile, whereas persistence increased with increasing wetness index (MAP/PET) in subsurface soils (30--176 cm). The relationship of C abundance (mg C g−1 soil) to climate varied among pools and with depth. Mineral-associated C in surface soils (<30 cm) increased more strongly with increasing wetness index than the free particulate C, but both pools showed attenuated responses to the wetness index at depth. Overall, these relationships suggest a strong influence of climate on soil C properties, and a potential loss of soil C from protected pools in areas with decreasing wetness. Relative persistence and abundance of C pools varied significantly among land cover types and soil parent material lithologies. This variability in each pool's relationship to environmental factors suggests that not all soil organic C is equally vulnerable to global change. Therefore, projections of future soil organic C based on patterns and responses of bulk soil organic C may be misleading.},

@article{Azizi2022SBB,
	abstract = {In alpine environments, the decomposition rate of soil organic carbon (SOC) is controlled by several biotic and abiotic factors, which mostly change simultaneously and often lead to freezing and thawing cycles. However, it is highly uncertain whether the temperature sensitivity of decomposition around the freezing point of water is similar as in higher temperature ranges. In this study, we conducted a full factorial incubation experiment using soil samples from a grassland site in the Tibetan Plateau. A manipulative freeze-thaw cycle was imposed to these soils by continuously changing temperature, from −5 to 10 $\,^{\circ}$C. Additional treatments included 4 levels of soil moisture at 15, 30, 60 and 90\% of water-filled pore space (WFPS), and two levels of O2 concentration at 0 and 20\%. We fitted the Arrhenius equation into the flux data to estimate the activation energy (Ea) and base flux rate (A) for each treatment level. Then, we predicted the dependence and sensitivity of decomposition rate (k) by implementing the Dual Arrhenius and Michaelis-Menten (DAMM) model using a Bayesian optimization approach. While soil temperature had the strongest control on SOC decomposition rate at all soil moisture and O2 levels, its intrinsic temperature sensitivity (Δk/ΔT) remained nearly constant across the entire temperature range except around 0 $\,^{\circ}$C. We found that Ea was higher in nearly dry or anoxic conditions, suggesting that in these extremes more energy is required for microbial activity to take place. These intrinsic sensitivities revealed that temperature (energy) is the main factor that limits decomposition in cold environments provided that moisture and oxygen are sufficiently available. Intrinsic sensitivities with respect to soil moisture and oxygen concentration were only relevant at very narrow ranges, when soils were almost dry or partially anoxic, and small changes within these narrow ranges may lead to very strong changes in decomposition rates.},

	abstract = {Abstract Tropical ecosystems strongly influence Earth's climate and weather patterns. Most tropical ecosystems remain warm year-round; nonetheless, their plants undergo seasonal cycles of carbon and water exchange. Previous research has shown the importance of precipitation and radiation as drivers of the seasonality of photosynthetic activity in the tropics. Although data are scarce, field-based studies have found that seasonal cycles at a handful of tropical sites do not match those in the land surface model (LSM) simulations. A comprehensive understanding and model comparison of how seasonal variations in tropical photosynthetic activity relate to climate is lacking. Here, we identify the relationships of precipitation and radiation with satellite-based proxies for photosynthetic activity (e.g., GOME-2 SIF, MAIAC EVI) for the pantropical region. Three dominant and spatially distinct seasonal relationships emerge: photosynthetic activity that is positively correlated with both drivers (36\% of tropical pixels), activity that increases following rain but decreases with radiation (28\%), and activity that increases following bright seasons but decreases with rain (14\%). We compare distributions of these observed relationships with those from LSMs. In general, compared to satellite-based proxies of photosynthetic activity, model simulations of gross primary productivity (GPP) overestimate the extent of positive correlations of photosynthetic activity with water and underestimate positive correlations with radiation. The largest discrepancies between simulations and observations are in the representation of regions where photosynthetic activity increases with radiation and decreases with rain. Our clear scheme for representing the relationship between climate and photosynthetic activity can be used to benchmark tropical seasonality of GPP in LSMs.},

@article{Stoner2021,
	abstract = {Managed grasslands have the potential to store carbon (C) and partially mitigate climate change. However, it remains difficult to predict potential C storage under a given soil or management practice. To study C storage dynamics due to long-term (1952--2009) phosphorus (P) fertilizer and irrigation treatments in New Zealand grasslands, we measured radiocarbon (14C) in archived soil along with observed changes in C stocks to constrain a compartmental soil model. Productivity increases from P application and irrigation in these trials resulted in very similar C accumulation rates between 1959 and 2009. The ∆14C changes over the same time period were similar in plots that were both irrigated and fertilized, and only differed in a non-irrigated fertilized plot. Model results indicated that decomposition rates of fast cycling C (0.1 to 0.2 year−1) increased to nearly offset increases in inputs. With increasing P fertilization, decomposition rates also increased in the slow pool (0.005 to 0.008 year−1). Our findings show sustained, significant (i.e. greater than 4 per mille) increases in C stocks regardless of treatment or inputs. As the majority of fresh inputs remain in the soil for less than 10 years, these long term increases reflect dynamics of the slow pool. Additionally, frequent irrigation was associated with reduced stocks and increased decomposition of fresh plant material. Rates of C gain and decay highlight trade-offs between productivity, nutrient availability, and soil C sequestration as a climate change mitigation strategy.},

	abstract = {Abstract Tropical forests fix large quantities of carbon from the atmosphere every year; however, the fate of this carbon as it travels through ecosystem compartments is poorly understood. In particular, there is a large degree of uncertainty regarding the time carbon spends in an ecosystem before it is respired and returns to the atmosphere as . We estimated the fate of carbon (trajectory of photosynthetically fixed carbon through a network of compartments) and its transit time (time it takes carbon to pass through the entire ecosystem, from fixation to respiration) for an old-growth tropical forest located in the foothills of the Andes of Colombia. We show that on average, 50\% of the carbon fixed at any given time is respired in  years, and 95\% is respired in  years. The transit time distribution shows that carbon in ecosystems is respired on a range of time-scales that span decades, but fast metabolic processes in vegetation dominate the return of carbon to the atmosphere. Synthesis. The transit time distribution integrates multiple ecosystem processes occurring at a wide range of time-scales. It reconciles measurements of the age of respired with estimates of mean residence time in woody biomass, and provides a new approach to interpret other ecosystem level metrics such as the ratio of net primary production to gross primary production.},

	abstract = {Tropical ecosystems experience particularly fast transformations largely as a consequence of land use and climate change. Consequences for ecosystem functioning and services are hard to predict and require analyzing multiple data sets simultaneously. Today, we are equipped with a wide range of spatio-temporal observation-based data streams that monitor the rapid transformations of tropical ecosystems in terms of state variables (e.g., biomass, leaf area, soil moisture) but also in terms of ecosystem processes (e.g., gross primary production, evapotranspiration, runoff). However, the underexplored joint potential of such data streams, combined with deficient access to data and processing, constrain our understanding of ecosystem functioning, despite the importance of tropical ecosystems in the regional-to-global carbon and water cycling. Our objectives are: 1. To facilitate access to regional ``Analysis Ready Data Cubes'' and enable efficient processing 2. To contribute to the understanding of ecosystem functioning and atmosphere-biosphere interactions. 3. To get a dynamic perspective of environmental conditions for biodiversity. To achieve our objectives, we developed a regional variant of an ``Earth System Data Lab'' (RegESDL) tailored to address the challenges of northern South America. The study region extensively covers natural ecosystems such as rainforest and savannas, and includes strong topographic gradients (0--6,500 masl). Currently, environmental threats such as deforestation and ecosystem degradation continue to increase. In this contribution, we show the value of the approach for characterizing ecosystem functioning through the efficient implementation of time series and dimensionality reduction analysis at pixel level. Specifically, we present an analysis of seasonality as it is manifested in multiple indicators of ecosystem primary production. We demonstrate that the RegESDL has the ability to underscore contrasting patterns of ecosystem seasonality and therefore has the potential to contribute to the characterization of ecosystem function. These results illustrate the potential of the RegESDL to explore complex land-surface processes and the need for further exploration. The paper concludes with some suggestions for developing future big-data infrastructures and its applications in the tropics.},

	abstract = {The global carbon-climate system is a complex dynamical system with multiple feedbacks among components, and to steer this system away from dangerous climate change, it may not be enough to prescribe action according to long-term scenarios of fossil fuel emissions. We introduce here concepts from control theory, a branch of applied mathematics that is effective at steering complex dynamical systems to desired states, and distinguish between open- and closed-loop control. We attempt (1) to show that current scientific work on carbon-climate feedbacks and climate policy more closely resembles the conceptual model of open- than closed-loop control, (2) to introduce a mathematical generalization of the carbon-climate system as a compartmental dynamical system that can facilitate the formal treatment of the closed-loop control problem, and (3) to formulate carbon-climate control as a congestion control problem, discussing important concepts such as observability and controllability. We also show that most previous discussions on climate change mitigation and policy development have relied on an implicit assumption of open-loop control that does not consider frequent corrections due to deviations of goals from observations. Using a reduced complexity model, we illustrate that the problem of managing the global carbon cycle can be abstracted as a network congestion problem, accounting for nonlinear behavior and feedback from a global carbon monitoring system. As opposed to scenarios, the goal of closed-loop control is to develop rules for continuously steering the global carbon-climate system away from dangerous climate change.},

	abstract = {Summary Non-structural carbon (NSC) storage (i.e. starch, soluble sugras and lipids) in tree stems play important roles in metabolism and growth. Their spatial distribution in wood may explain species-specific differences in carbon storage dynamics, growth and survival. However, quantitative information on the spatial distribution of starch and lipids in wood is sparse due to methodological limitations. Here we assessed differences in wood NSC and lipid storage between tropical tree species with different growth and mortality rates and contrasting functional types. We measured starch and soluble sugars in wood cores up to 4 cm deep into the stem using standard chemical quantification methods and histological slices stained with Lugol's iodine. We also detected neutral lipids using histological slices stained with Oil-Red-O. The histological method allowed us to group individuals into two categories according to their starch storage strategy: fiber-storing trees and parenchyma-storing trees. The first group had a bigger starch pool, slower growth and lower mortality rates than the second group. Lipid storage was found in wood parenchyma in five species and was related to low mortality rates. The quantification of the spatial distribution of starch and lipids in wood improves our understanding of NSC dynamics in trees and reveals additional dimensions of tree growth and survival strategies.},

@article{Jimenez2020,
	abstract = {Abstract Climate is a strong determinant of tropical forest productivity; therefore, it is often assumed that Amazonian forest growing on the same local rainfall regime responds similarly to fluctuations in rainfall, independently of soil differences among them. We evaluated intra- and inter-annual variation of net primary productivity (NPP) components, and forest dynamics during 2004--2012 yr in five forests on clay, clay-loam, sandy-clay-loam, sandy-loam and loamy-sand soils, and the same local rainfall regime in northwestern Amazonia (Colombia). The questions were as follows: (1) Do NPP components and forest dynamics respond synchronously to temporal rainfall fluctuations? (2) Are the responses between above and belowground components and forest dynamics similar for different forest stands? A slight and complex synchronicity among different NPP components in their response to temporal rainfall fluctuations were found; few plots showed that aboveground biomass (AGB) and stem growth were susceptible to rainfall fluctuations, while belowground components (fine roots) showed correlation with one-month lagged rainfall. Furthermore, despite that northwestern Amazonia is considered relatively aseasonal, litterfall showed high seasonality in the loam-soil forest group, as well as the fine-root mass, particularly during the 2005 drought. Litterfall correlation with rainfall of sandy-loam terra-firme forest was time lagged as well as fine-root mass of the loamy-sand forest. The correlation between mortality and rainfall was weak, except for the loamy-sand forest (white-sand forest, 77\%). High mortality rates occurred in the non-flooded forests for the censuses that included the dry years (2004--2005, 2005--2006). Interestingly, litterfall, AGB increment, and recruitment showed high correlation among forests, particularly within the loam-soil forest group. Nonetheless, leaf area index (LAI) measured in the most contrasting forests (clay and loamy-sand soil) was poorly correlated with rainfall, but highly correlated among them, which could be indicating a phenotypic response to the incident radiation in these sites; also, LAI did not reflect the differences in NPP components and their response to rainfall. Overall, the different temporal behavior of NPP components among forests in relation to rainfall fluctuations suggests the important role that soil exerts on the responses of plant species in each site, besides their effect on forest dynamics and community composition.},

	abstract = {The representation of carbon allocation (CA) in ecosystem differs tremendously among models, resulting in diverse responses of carbon cycling and storage to global change. Several studies have highlighted discrepancies between empirical observations and model predictions, attributing these differences to problems of model structure. We analyzed the mathematical representation of CA in models using concepts from dynamical systems theory; we reviewed a representative sample of models of CA in vegetation and developed a model database within the Python package bgc-md. We asked whether these representations can be generalized as a linear system, or whether a more general framework is needed to accommodate nonlinearities. Some of the vegetation systems simulated with the reviewed models have a fixed partitioning of photosynthetic products, independent of environmental forcing. Vegetation is often represented as a linear system without storage compartments. Yet, other structures with nonlinearities have also been proposed, with important consequences on the temporal trajectories of ecosystem carbon compartments. The proposed mathematical framework unifies the representation of alternative CA schemes, facilitating their classification according to mathematical properties as well as their potential temporal behaviour. It can represent complex processes in a compact form, which can potentially facilitate dialog among empiricists, theoreticians, and modellers.},

	abstract = {Hydric seasonality, dry or flooding periods, has been the explanation given by dendrochronologists for the formation of growth rings in tropical trees. However, under tropical hyper-humid conditions, there are species with growth periodicity and, therefore, with visible growth rings useful for dendrochronology. We classify, for the first time, the anatomical structures of the growth rings of the tropical trees from the Biogeographic Choc{\'o} Region. An annual rainfall >7200 mm without hydric seasonality characterizes the studied forest. We classify the tree rings as present (well or poorly defined) or absent. We also took into account the feasibility of tree-ring dating (dendrochronological potential). We characterized 81 species of trees belonging to 38 families. About 82{\%} of species had growth rings, 46{\%} well defined, and 36{\%} poorly defined, and 18{\%} with absent rings. Dendrochronological potential was high (14{\%}), medium (25{\%}), low (43{\%}), and null (18{\%}). We contrast our results with vast literature around tropics. Our results suggest that still without any hydric seasonality, many tropical tree species develop growth rings. Our findings drive to new questions: What is the periodicity of tree rings in these non-seasonal hyper-humid environments? What other subtle seasonality could be involved in the growth periodicity of these species, or are they genetic?},

@article{Kattge2020,
	abstract = {Abstract Plant traits - the morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics of plants - determine how plants respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, and influence ecosystem properties and their benefits and detriments to people. Plant trait data thus represent the basis for a vast area of research spanning from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology, to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem and landscape management, restoration, biogeography and earth system modelling. Since its foundation in 2007, the TRY database of plant traits has grown continuously. It now provides unprecedented data coverage under an open access data policy and is the main plant trait database used by the research community worldwide. Increasingly, the TRY database also supports new frontiers of trait-based plant research, including the identification of data gaps and the subsequent mobilization or measurement of new data. To support this development, in this article we evaluate the extent of the trait data compiled in TRY and analyse emerging patterns of data coverage and representativeness. Best species coverage is achieved for categorical traits?almost complete coverage for ?plant growth form?. However, most traits relevant for ecology and vegetation modelling are characterized by continuous intraspecific variation and trait?environmental relationships. These traits have to be measured on individual plants in their respective environment. Despite unprecedented data coverage, we observe a humbling lack of completeness and representativeness of these continuous traits in many aspects. We, therefore, conclude that reducing data gaps and biases in the TRY database remains a key challenge and requires a coordinated approach to data mobilization and trait measurements. This can only be achieved in collaboration with other initiatives.},

@article{Metzler2020JAMES,
	abstract = {Abstract Radiocarbon (14C) is a powerful tracer of the global carbon cycle that is commonly used to assess carbon cycling rates in various Earth system reservoirs and as a benchmark to assess model performance. Therefore, it has been recommended that Earth System Models (ESMs) participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 report predicted radiocarbon values for relevant carbon pools. However, a detailed representation of radiocarbon dynamics may be an impractical burden on model developers. Here, we present an alternative approach to compute radiocarbon values from the numerical output of an ESM that does not explicitly represent these dynamics. The approach requires computed 12C stocks and fluxes among all carbon pools for a particular simulation of the model. From this output, a time-dependent linear compartmental system is computed with its respective state-transition matrix. Using transient atmospheric 14C values as inputs, the state-transition matrix is then applied to compute radiocarbon values for each pool, the average value for the entire system, and component fluxes. We demonstrate the approach with ELMv1-ECA, the land component of an ESM model that explicitly represents 12C, and 14C in 7 soil pools and 10 vertical layers. Results from our proposed method are highly accurate (relative error <0.01\%) compared with the ELMv1-ECA 12C and 14C predictions, demonstrating the potential to use this approach in CMIP6 and other model simulations that do not explicitly represent 14C.},

	abstract = {In this chapter, approaches to modelling processes at the ecosystem level are presented. A classification of ecosystem models is provided. The five main classes of models are as follows: physiological, biogeochemical, gap, biogeophysical and dynamic global vegetation models. After this overview, a general ecosystem carbon model is introduced. Plant ecophysiological and biogeochemical processes are represented in mathematical terms (vectors and matrices), from carbon dioxide uptake to carbon allocation to carbon turnover in soils. In addition, the effects of environmental factors on these processes are modelled. Two models are then discussed in more detail: a simple vegetation-soil model and the eight-pool model of Luo and Weng. Furthermore, highly relevant model parameterization problems are addressed, that is, the role of inputs and cycling rates in ecosystem carbon storage, residence and response times, as well as disturbance effects.},

@article{Sierra2018GBC,
	abstract = {The question of why some types of organic matter are more persistent while others decompose quickly in soils has motivated a large amount of research in recent years. Persistence is commonly characterized as turnover or mean residence time of soil organic matter (SOM). However, turnover and residence times are ambiguous measures of persistence, because they could represent the concept of either age or transit time. To disambiguate these concepts and propose a metric to assess SOM persistence, we calculated age and transit time distributions for a wide range of soil organic carbon models. Furthermore, we show how age and transit time distributions can be obtained from a stochastic approach that takes a deterministic model of mass transfers among different pools and creates an equivalent stochastic model at the level of atoms. Using this approach we show the following: (1) Age distributions have relatively old mean values and long tails in relation to transit time distributions, suggesting that carbon stored in soils is on average much older than carbon in the release flux. (2) The difference between mean ages and mean transit times is large, with estimates of soil organic carbon persistence on the order of centuries or millennia when assessed using ages and on the order of decades when using transit or turnover times. (3) The age distribution is an appropriate metric to characterize persistence of SOM. An important implication of our analysis is that random chance is a factor that helps to explain why some organic matter persists for millennia in soil.},

	abstract = {Abstract Models representing exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere include a large variety of processes and mechanisms, and have increased in complexity in the last decades. These models are no exception of the simulation versus understanding conundrum previously articulated for models of the physical climate, which states that increasing detail in process representation in models, and the simulations they produce, hinders understanding of holistic system behavior. However, recent theoretical progress on the mathematical representation of the carbon cycle in ecosystems may help to provide a general framework for the qualitative understanding of models without compromising detail in process representation. Here we (1) briefly review recent ideas on the theory of transient dynamics of the terrestrial carbon cycle and its matrix representation, pointing out issues of interpretation, (2) show that these ideas can be further generalized in the mathematical concept of nonautonomous compartmental systems, and (3) provide thoughts on how this framework can be used to address a new set of questions in carbon cycle science.},

@article{Spohn2018,
	abstract = {We explore the question of how long elements cycle in terrestrial ecosystems and show that to address this question, a broader conceptual framework is needed that specifies ages and transit times. We calculated age and transit time distributions of five elements in a forest and two grassland ecosystems. Moreover, we assessed how ages and transit times of elements change in various scenarios. Mean age and mean transit time of all elements were smaller in the two grassland ecosystems than in the forest ecosystem due to the smaller element stocks in the grasslands in relation to the inputs. Phosphorus (P) had the largest mean transit time and mean age of all elements in the forest ecosystem (450 and 469 years) as well as in the high elevation grassland (82 and 80 years). Mean ages and mean transit times changed linearly with the stock in one pool. Changes in the internal cycling of elements in the ecosystem that did not imply the introduction of another pool had no effect on age and transit time. However, the introduction of a stable P pool in the mineral soil led to a divergence of mean transit time and mean age of P. Taken together, based on the probabilistic approach proposed here, we were able to precisely calculate not only the mean times elements need to transit different ecosystems and the ages they reach while cycling the ecosystems, but also the probability distribution of ages and transit times.},

	abstract = {Improved quantification of the factors controlling soil organic matter (SOM) stabilization at continental to global scales is needed to inform projections of the largest actively cycling terrestrial carbon pool on Earth, and its response to environmental change. Biogeochemical models rely almost exclusively on clay content to modify rates of SOM turnover and fluxes of climate-active CO2 to the atmosphere. Emerging conceptual understanding, however, suggests other soil physicochemical properties may predict SOM stabilization better than clay content. We addressed this discrepancy by synthesizing data from over 5,500 soil profiles spanning continental scale environmental gradients. Here, we demonstrate that other physicochemical parameters are much stronger predictors of SOM content, with clay content having relatively little explanatory power. We show that exchangeable calcium strongly predicted SOM content in water-limited, alkaline soils, whereas with increasing moisture availability and acidity, iron- and aluminum-oxyhydroxides emerged as better predictors, demonstrating that the relative importance of SOM stabilization mechanisms scales with climate and acidity. These results highlight the urgent need to modify biogeochemical models to better reflect the role of soil physicochemical properties in SOM cycling.},

	abstract = {What is the distribution of the time required for particles to transit a compartmental system? What is the age distribution of particles in the system? These questions are important to understand the dynamics of modeled processes in many scientific fields. Until now, they could be answered only for systems in steady state, but the steady-state assumption is very restrictive and almost always unreasonable. Nonlinear relations between compartments and changing environmental factors keep systems permanently changing. A theory is presented here to describe the time evolution of age densities under changing environmental influences in nonlinear systems. An application is provided, addressing questions of high scientific and societal interest such as the lifetime of fossil fuel-derived atmospheric carbon.Many processes in nature are modeled using compartmental systems (reservoir/pool/box systems). Usually, they are expressed as a set of first-order differential equations describing the transfer of matter across a network of compartments. The concepts of age of matter in compartments and the time required for particles to transit the system are important diagnostics of these models with applications to a wide range of scientific questions. Until now, explicit formulas for transit-time and age distributions of nonlinear time-dependent compartmental systems were not available. We compute densities for these types of systems under the assumption of well-mixed compartments. Assuming that a solution of the nonlinear system is available at least numerically, we show how to construct a linear time-dependent system with the same solution trajectory. We demonstrate how to exploit this solution to compute transit-time and age distributions in dependence on given start values and initial age distributions. Furthermore, we derive equations for the time evolution of quantiles and moments of the age distributions. Our results generalize available density formulas for the linear time-independent case and mean-age formulas for the linear time-dependent case. As an example, we apply our formulas to a nonlinear and a linear version of a simple global carbon cycle model driven by a time-dependent input signal which represents fossil fuel additions. We derive time-dependent age distributions for all compartments and calculate the time it takes to remove fossil carbon in a business-as-usual scenario.},

	abstract = {Reservoir models play an important role in representing fluxes of matter and energy in ecological systems and are the basis of most models in biogeochemistry. These models are commonly used to study the effects of environmental change on the cycling of biogeochemical elements and to predict potential transitions of ecosystems to alternative states. To study critical regime changes of time-dependent, externally forced biogeochemical systems, we analyze the behavior of reservoir models typical for element cycling (e.g., terrestrial carbon cycle) with respect to time-varying signals by applying the mathematical concept of input to state stability (ISS). In particular, we discuss ISS as a generalization of preceding stability notions for non-autonomous, non-linear reservoir models represented by systems of ordinary differential equations explicitly dependent on time and a time-varying input signal. We also show how ISS enhances existing stability concepts, previously only available for linear time variant (LTV) systems, to a tool applicable also in the non-linear case.},

This tool, the measuRing package, integrates measurement of tree-ring widths with powerful statistical analyses within the R environment. The package assists in the identification of ring borders on scanned image sections from dendrochronological samples. It processes the image section and computes luminance data from images producing a matrix of gray values and a time series of smoothed gray values. Luminance data is plotted on segmented images for users to perform both visual identification of ring borders, or manual control of automatic detection. The package provides functions to visually include/exclude ring borders on the R graphical device, or automatically detect ring borders using a linear detection algorithm. This algorithm detects ring borders according to negative extreme values in the smoothed time-series of gray values. Users of the package can also implement other algorithms for automatic detection. },

@article{Sierra2015EM,
	abstract = {We propose here a general mathematical framework to represent soil organic matter dynamics. This framework is expressed in the language of dynamical systems and generalizes previous modeling approaches. It is based on a set of six basic principles about the decomposition of soil organic matter: 1) mass balance, 2) substrate dependence of decomposition, 3) heterogeneity of the speed of decay, 4) internal transformations of organic matter, 5) environmental variability effects, and 6) substrate interactions. We show how the majority of models previously proposed are special cases of this general model. This approach provides tools to classify models according to the main principles or concepts they include. It also helps to identify a priori the general behavior of different models or groups of models. Another important characteristic of the proposed mathematical representation is the possibility to develop particular models at any level of detail. This characteristic is described as a modeling hierarchy, in which a general model of a high degree of abstraction can accommodate specific realizations of model structure for specific modeling objectives. This framework also allows us to study general properties of groups of models such as their qualitative behavior, time-scale of application, and their dynamic stability. For instance, we find conditions under which models are asymptotically stable, i.e. converge to a stable steady-state in the long-term, but may approach this state with or without oscillations. We also expand the concept of dynamic stability for models that include time-dependencies and do not converge to a fixed steady-state, but rather to a region of stability in the state-space. As an example of the application of the concept of dynamic stability, we show how this framework helps to explain the acclimation of soil respiration fluxes in soil warming experiments.},

	abstract = {Plant diversity strongly influences ecosystem functions and services, such as soil carbon storage. However, the mechanisms underlying the positive plant diversity effects on soil carbon storage are poorly understood. We explored this relationship using long-term data from a grassland biodiversity experiment (The Jena Experiment) and radiocarbon (14C) modelling. Here we show that higher plant diversity increases rhizosphere carbon inputs into the microbial community resulting in both increased microbial activity and carbon storage. Increases in soil carbon were related to the enhanced accumulation of recently fixed carbon in high-diversity plots, while plant diversity had less pronounced effects on the decomposition rate of existing carbon. The present study shows that elevated carbon storage at high plant diversity is a direct function of the soil microbial community, indicating that the increase in carbon storage is mainly limited by the integration of new carbon into soil and less by the decomposition of existing soil carbon.},

@article{3234,
	abstract = {The determination of the age of tropical trees and palms is of significant importance for ecological studies and designing sustainable forest management plans. Radiocarbon is a powerful tool that can potentially help the determination of ages and growth rates of these plants. However, the application of 14C analyses has one important problem for trees without annual rings and palms: the calibration of 14C measurements with common programs such as CALIBomb or OxCal gives erroneous determinations for wood formed between AD 1954 and 1964. This problem is illustrated here using samples from a tropical tree (Otoba gracilipes) and a tropical palm (Oenocarpus bataua). This study shows how the use of two adjacent samples can help to unambiguously determine the real age of the samples and their mean growth rates. For comparison, long-term growth measurements for both species were used and it was determined that 14C analyses provide accurate determination of growth rates for tropical trees and palms. Furthermore, the application of 14C analyses in palms allows the determination of the rosette stage, rarely quantified in forest inventories and life-history studies.DOI: 10.2458/56.16486},

@article{Sierra2012CBM,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Regrowing tropical forests worldwide sequester important amounts of carbon and restore part of the C emissions emitted by deforestation. However, there are large uncertainties concerning the rates of carbon accumulation after the abandonment of agricultural and pasture land. We report here accumulation of total carbon stocks (TCS) in a chronosequence of secondary forests at a mid-elevation landscape (900-1200 m asl) in the Andean mountains of Colombia.RESULTS:We found positive accumulation rates for all ecosystem pools except soil carbon, which showed no significant trend of recovery after 36 years of secondary succession. We used these data to develop a simple model to predict accumulation of TCS over time. This model performed remarkably well predicting TCS at other chronosequences in the Americas (Root Mean Square Error < 40 Mg C ha-1), which provided an opportunity to explore different assumptions in the calculation of large-scale carbon budgets. Simulations of TCS with our empirical model were used to test three assumptions often made in carbon budgets: 1) the use of carbon accumulation in tree aboveground biomass as a surrogate for accumulation of TCS, 2) the implicit consideration of carbon legacies from previous land-use, and 3) the omission of landscape age in calculating accumulation rates of TCS.CONCLUSIONS:Our simulations showed that in many situations carbon can be released from regrowing secondary forests depending on the amount of carbon legacies and the average age of the landscape. In most cases, the rates used to predict carbon accumulation in the Americas were above the rates predicted in our simulations. These biome level rates seemed to be realistic only in landscapes not affected by carbon legacies from previous land-use and mean ages of around 10 years.},

              Soil organic carbon (SOC) models currently in widespread use omit known microbial processes, and assume the existence of a SOC pool whose intrinsic properties confer persistence for centuries to millennia, despite evidence from priming and aggregate turnover that cast doubt on the existence of SOC with profound intrinsic stability. Here we show that by including microbial interactions in a SOC model, persistence can be explained as a feedback between substrate availability, mineral protection and microbial population size, without invoking an unproven pool that is intrinsically stable for centuries. The microbial SOC model based on this concept reproduces long-term data (r
              2
               = 0.92; n = 90), global SOC distribution (rmse = 4.7 +/− 0.6 kg C m
              −2
              ), and total global SOC in the top 0.3 m (822 Pg C) accurately. SOC dynamics based on a microbial feedback without stable pools are thus consistent with global SOC distribution. This has important implications for carbon management, suggesting that relatively fast cycling, rather than recalcitrant, SOC must form the primary target of efforts to build SOC stocks.},

	abstract = {Abstract In the context of phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, most climate simulations use prescribed atmospheric CO2 concentration and therefore do not interactively include the effect of carbon cycle feedbacks. However, the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario has additionally been run by earth system models with prescribed CO2 emissions. This paper analyzes the climate projections of 11 earth system models (ESMs) that performed both emission-driven and concentration-driven RCP8.5 simulations. When forced by RCP8.5 CO2 emissions, models simulate a large spread in atmospheric CO2; the simulated 2100 concentrations range between 795 and 1145 ppm. Seven out of the 11 ESMs simulate a larger CO2 (on average by 44 ppm, 985 ± 97 ppm by 2100) and hence higher radiative forcing (by 0.25 W m−2) when driven by CO2 emissions than for the concentration-driven scenarios (941 ppm). However, most of these models already overestimate the present-day CO2, with the present-day biases reasonably well correlated with future atmospheric concentrations’ departure from the prescribed concentration. The uncertainty in CO2 projections is mainly attributable to uncertainties in the response of the land carbon cycle. As a result of simulated higher CO2 concentrations than in the concentration-driven simulations, temperature projections are generally higher when ESMs are driven with CO2 emissions. Global surface temperature change by 2100 (relative to present day) increased by 3.9° ± 0.9°C for the emission-driven simulations compared to 3.7° ± 0.7°C in the concentration-driven simulations. Although the lower ends are comparable in both sets of simulations, the highest climate projections are significantly warmer in the emission-driven simulations because of stronger carbon cycle feedbacks.},

biogeochemical models that represent coupled carbon–nitrogen dynamics
presents opportunities to deepen understanding of ecosystem responses to
environmental change. The MIcrobial-MIneral Carbon Stabilization (MIMICS)
model explicitly represents microbial physiology and physicochemical
stabilization of soil carbon (C) on regional and global scales. Here we
present a new version of MIMICS with coupled C and nitrogen (N) cycling
through litter, microbial, and soil organic matter (SOM) pools. The model
was parameterized and validated against C and N data from the Long-Term
Inter-site Decomposition Experiment Team (LIDET; six litter types, 10 years of
observations, and 13 sites across North America). The model simulates C and N
losses from litterbags in the LIDET study with reasonable accuracy (C:
R2=0.63; N: R2=0.29), which is comparable with simulations
from the DAYCENT model that implicitly represents microbial activity (C:
R2=0.67; N: R2=0.30). Subsequently, we evaluated equilibrium
values of stocks (total soil C and N, microbial biomass C and N, inorganic
N) and microbial process rates (soil heterotrophic respiration, N
mineralization) simulated by MIMICS-CN across the 13 simulated LIDET sites
against published observations from other continent-wide datasets. We found
that MIMICS-CN produces equilibrium values in line with measured values,
showing that the model generates plausible estimates of ecosystem soil
biogeochemical dynamics across continental-scale gradients. MIMICS-CN
provides a platform for coupling C and N projections in a microbially explicit
model, but experiments still need to identify the physiological and
stoichiometric characteristics of soil microbes, especially under
environmental change scenarios.},

Radiocarbon is one of the only tools to study the dynamics of C in soils on decadal to millennial timescales.

              Background
              Large uncertainty in modeling land carbon (C) uptake heavily impedes the accurate prediction of the global C budget. Identifying the uncertainty sources among models is crucial for model improvement yet has been difficult due to multiple feedbacks within Earth System Models (ESMs). Here we present a Matrix-based Ensemble Model Inter-comparison Platform (MEMIP) under a unified model traceability framework to evaluate multiple soil organic carbon (SOC) models. Using the MEMIP, we analyzed how the vertically resolved soil biogeochemistry structure influences SOC prediction in two soil organic matter (SOM) models. By comparing the model outputs from the C-only and CN modes, the SOC differences contributed by individual processes and N feedback between vegetation and soil were explicitly disentangled.
            
            
              Results
              Results showed that the multi-layer models with a vertically resolved structure predicted significantly higher SOC than the single layer models over the historical simulation (1900–2000). The SOC difference between the multi-layer models was remarkably higher than between the single-layer models. Traceability analysis indicated that over 80\% of the SOC increase in the multi-layer models was contributed by the incorporation of depth-related processes, while SOC differences were similarly contributed by the processes and N feedback between models with the same soil depth representation.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The output suggested that feedback is a non-negligible contributor to the inter-model difference of SOC prediction, especially between models with similar process representation. Further analysis with TRENDY v7 and more extensive MEMIP outputs illustrated the potential important role of multi-layer structure to enlarge the current ensemble spread and the necessity of more detail model decomposition to fully disentangle inter-model differences. We stressed the importance of analyzing ensemble outputs from the fundamental model structures, and holding a holistic view in understanding the ensemble uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Computer models are ubiquitous tools used to represent systems across many scientific and engineering domains. For any given system, many computer models exist, each built on different assumptions and demonstrating variability in the ways in which these systems can be represented. This variability is known as epistemic uncertainty, i.e. uncertainty in our knowledge of how these systems operate. Two primary sources of epistemic uncertainty are (1) uncertain parameter values and (2) uncertain mathematical representations of the processes that comprise the system. Many formal methods exist to analyse parameter-based epistemic uncertainty, while process-representation-based epistemic uncertainty is often analysed post hoc, incompletely, informally, or is ignored. In this model description paper we present the multi-assumption architecture and testbed (MAAT v1.0) designed to formally and completely analyse process-representation-based epistemic uncertainty. MAAT is a modular modelling code that can simply and efficiently vary model structure (process representation), allowing for the generation and running of large model ensembles that vary in process representation, parameters, parameter values, and environmental conditions during a single execution of the code. MAAT v1.0 approaches epistemic uncertainty through sensitivity analysis, assigning variability in model output to processes (process representation and parameters) or to individual parameters. In this model description paper we describe MAAT and, by using a simple groundwater model example, verify that the sensitivity analysis algorithms have been correctly implemented. The main system model currently coded in MAAT is a unified, leaf-scale enzyme kinetic model of C3 photosynthesis. In the Appendix we describe the photosynthesis model and the unification of multiple representations of photosynthetic processes. The numerical solution to leaf-scale photosynthesis is verified and examples of process variability in temperature response functions are provided. For rapid application to new systems, the MAAT algorithms for efficient variation of model structure and sensitivity analysis are agnostic of the specific system model employed. Therefore MAAT provides a tool for the development of novel or toy models in many domains, i.e. not only photosynthesis, facilitating rapid informal and formal comparison of alternative modelling approaches.},

            The increasing complexity of Earth system models has inspired efforts to quantitatively assess model fidelity through rigorous comparison with best available measurements and observational data products. Earth system models exhibit a high degree of spread in predictions of land biogeochemistry, biogeophysics, and hydrology, which are sensitive to forcing from other model components. Based on insights from prior land model evaluation studies and community workshops, the authors developed an open source model benchmarking software package that generates graphical diagnostics and scores model performance in support of the International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) project. Employing a suite of in situ, remote sensing, and reanalysis data sets, the ILAMB package performs comprehensive model assessment across a wide range of land variables and generates a hierarchical set of web pages containing statistical analyses and figures designed to provide the user insights into strengths and weaknesses of multiple models or model versions. Described here is the benchmarking philosophy and mathematical methodology embodied in the most recent implementation of the ILAMB package. Comparison methods unique to a few specific data sets are presented, and guidelines for configuring an ILAMB analysis and interpreting resulting model performance scores are discussed. ILAMB is being adopted by modeling teams and centers during model development and for model intercomparison projects, and community engagement is sought for extending evaluation metrics and adding new observational data sets to the benchmarking framework.

	abstract = {Abstract. By coordinating the design and distribution of global climate model simulations of the past, current, and future climate, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) has become one of the foundational elements of climate science. However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850–near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions:  – How does the Earth system respond to forcing? – What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases?  – How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios? This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.},

abstract = {In the last 80 years, a number of mathematical models of different level of complexity have been developed to describe biogeochemical processes in soils, spanning spatial scales from few μm to thousands of km and temporal scales from hours to centuries. Most of these models are based on kinetic and stoichiometric laws that constrain elemental cycling within the soil and the nutrient and carbon exchange with vegetation and the atmosphere. While biogeochemical model performance has been previously assessed in other reviews, less attention has been devoted to the mathematical features of the models, and how these are related to spatial and temporal scales. In this review, we consider ∼250 biogeochemical models, highlighting similarities in their theoretical frameworks and illustrating how their mathematical structure and formulation are related to the spatial and temporal scales of the model applications. Our analysis shows that similar kinetic and stoichiometric laws, formulated to mechanistically represent the complex underlying biochemical constraints, are common to most models, providing a basis for their classification. Moreover, a historic analysis reveals that the complexity and degree and number of nonlinearities generally increased with date, while they decreased with increasing spatial and temporal scale of interest. We also found that mathematical formulations specifically developed for certain scales (e.g., first order decay rates assumed in yearly time scale decomposition models) often tend to be used also at other spatial and temporal scales different from the original ones, possibly resulting in inconsistencies between theoretical formulations and model application. It is thus critical that future modeling efforts carefully account for the scale-dependence of their mathematical formulations, especially when applied to a wide range of scales.}

With a comprehensive review of {\textasciitilde}250 models, we assess how models are validated depending on their objectives and features, discuss how validation of predictive models can be improved. We find a critical lack of independent validation using observed time series. Conducting such validations should be a priority to improve the model reliability. Approximately 60\% of the models we analysed are not designed for predictions, but rather for conceptual understanding of soil processes. These models provide important insights by identifying key processes and alternative formalisms that can be relevant for predictive models.

            Soils store the largest amount of carbon (C) in the biosphere, and the C pool in soil is critical to the global C balance. Numerous microbial models have been developed over the last few decades to represent microbial processes that regulate the responses of soil organic carbon (SOC) to climate change. However, the representation of microbial processes varies, and how microbial processes are incorporated into SOC models has not been well explored. Here, we reviewed 71 microbial models to characterize the microbial processes incorporated into SOC models and analyzed variations in mechanistic complexity. We revealed that (a) four processes (microbial‐mediated decomposition, mineral interaction, microbial necromass recycling, and active and dormant microbial dynamics) are commonly incorporated in microbial models, (b) ∼48\% of models simulate only one microbial process (i.e., microbial‐mediated decomposition) and 35\% of models simulate two microbial processes: for example, microbial‐mediated decomposition and mineral interaction, (c) more than 80\% microbial models use nonlinear equations, such as forward Michaelis‐Menten kinetics, to represent SOC decomposition, (d) the concept of persistence of SOC due to its intrinsic properties has been replaced by organo‐mineral interaction (∼39\% of microbial models) that protects SOC from decomposition, and (e) various temperature and moisture modifiers and pH effects have been used to explain the environmental effect on microbial processes. In the future, to realistically incorporate microbial processes into Earth System Models, it is imperative to identify experimental evidence on rate limitation processes and firmly ground model structure on the field and laboratory data.

            Plain Language Summary
            Soil stores the largest amount of carbon (C) in land ecosystems and, thus, has the potential to regulate climate change. To understand soil C processes under climate change, researchers have developed numerous microbial models that focus on the role of microorganisms in soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition. In this study, we reviewed 71 microbial models on how microbial processes are represented for their regulation of SOC dynamics. These models commonly include four processes: microbially mediated decomposition, mineral interaction, microbial necromass recycling, and dormancy of microbial activity. More than three‐fourths of the models use nonlinear equations to describe the decomposition of SOC. The concept of SOC stability has shifted from chemical‐based properties of SOC to interactions between SOC and minerals. Our review also revealed that microbial models vary greatly in representing environmental effects, such as temperature, soil moisture, and soil pH, on microbial processes. Finally, we recommend the use of data in guiding the future development of microbial models.

This review explores existing and novel advances in photosynthesis measurements that are certain to provide innovative directions in plant science research. First, we address gas exchange approaches from leaf to ecosystem scales. Leaf level gas exchange is a mature method but recent improvements to the user interface and environmental controls of commercial systems have resulted in faster and higher quality data collection. Canopy chamber and micrometeorological methods have also become more standardized tools and have an advanced understanding of ecosystem functioning under a changing environment and through long time series data coupled with community data sharing. Second, we review proximal and remote sensing approaches to measure photosynthesis, including hyperspectral reflectance- and fluorescence-based techniques. These techniques have long been used with aircraft and orbiting satellites, but lower-cost sensors and improved statistical analyses are allowing these techniques to become applicable at smaller scales to quantify changes in the underlying biochemistry of photosynthesis. Within the past decade measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence from earth-orbiting satellites have measured Solar Induced Fluorescence (SIF) enabling estimates of global ecosystem productivity. Finally, we highlight that stronger interactions of scientists across disciplines will benefit our capacity to accurately estimate productivity at regional and global scales. Applying the multiple techniques outlined in this review at scales from the leaf to the globe are likely to advance understanding of plant functioning from the organelle to the ecosystem.},

              Solar‐induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a remotely sensed optical signal emitted during the light reactions of photosynthesis. The past two decades have witnessed an explosion in availability of SIF data at increasingly higher spatial and temporal resolutions, sparking applications in diverse research sectors (e.g., ecology, agriculture, hydrology, climate, and socioeconomics). These applications must deal with complexities caused by tremendous variations in scale and the impacts of interacting and superimposing plant physiology and three‐dimensional vegetation structure on the emission and scattering of SIF. At present, these complexities have not been overcome. To advance future research, the two companion reviews aim to (1) develop an analytical framework for inferring terrestrial vegetation structures and function that are tied to SIF emission, (2) synthesize progress and identify challenges in SIF research via the lens of multi‐sector applications, and (3) map out actionable solutions to tackle these challenges and offer our vision for research priorities over the next 5–10 years based on the proposed analytical framework. This paper is the first of the two companion reviews, and theory oriented. It introduces a theoretically rigorous yet practically applicable analytical framework. Guided by this framework, we offer theoretical perspectives on three overarching questions: (1)
              The forward (mechanism) question
              —How are the dynamics of SIF affected by terrestrial ecosystem structure and function? (2)
              The inference question
              : What aspects of terrestrial ecosystem structure, function, and service can be reliably inferred from remotely sensed SIF and how? (3)
              The innovation question
              : What innovations are needed to realize the full potential of SIF remote sensing for real‐world applications under climate change? The analytical framework elucidates that process complexity must be appreciated in inferring ecosystem structure and function from the observed SIF; this framework can serve as a diagnosis and inference tool for versatile applications across diverse spatial and temporal scales.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial carbon cycle models have incorporated increasingly more processes as a means to achieve more-realistic representations of ecosystem carbon cycling. Despite this, there are large across-model variations in the simulation and projection of carbon cycling. Several model intercomparison projects (MIPs), for example, the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) (historical simulations), Trends in Net Land–Atmosphere Carbon Exchange (TRENDY), and Multiscale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP), have sought to understand intermodel differences. In this study, the authors developed a suite of new techniques to conduct post-MIP analysis to gain insights into uncertainty sources across 25 models in the three MIPs. First, terrestrial carbon storage dynamics were characterized by a three-dimensional (3D) model output space with coordinates of carbon residence time, net primary productivity (NPP), and carbon storage potential. The latter represents the potential of an ecosystem to lose or gain carbon. This space can be used to measure how and why model output differs. Models with a nitrogen cycle generally exhibit lower annual NPP in comparison with other models, and mostly negative carbon storage potential. Second, a transient traceability framework was used to decompose any given carbon cycle model into traceable components and identify the sources of model differences. The carbon residence time (or NPP) was traced to baseline carbon residence time (or baseline NPP related to the maximum carbon input), environmental scalars, and climate forcing. Third, by applying a variance decomposition method, the authors show that the intermodel differences in carbon storage can be mainly attributed to the baseline carbon residence time and baseline NPP ({\textgreater}90\% in the three MIPs). The three techniques developed in this study offer a novel approach to gain more insight from existing MIPs and can point out directions for future MIPs. Since this study is conducted at the global scale for an overview on intermodel differences, future studies should focus more on regional analysis to identify the sources of uncertainties and improve models at the specified mechanism level.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The land and ocean absorb on average just over half of the anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) every year. These CO2 "sinks" are modulated by climate change and variability. Here we use a suite of nine dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) and four ocean biogeochemical general circulation models (OBGCMs) to estimate trends driven by global and regional climate and atmospheric CO2 in land and oceanic CO2 exchanges with the atmosphere over the period 1990–2009, to attribute these trends to underlying processes in the models, and to quantify the uncertainty and level of inter-model agreement. The models were forced with reconstructed climate fields and observed global atmospheric CO2; land use and land cover changes are not included for the DGVMs. Over the period 1990–2009, the DGVMs simulate a mean global land carbon sink of −2.4 ± 0.7 Pg C yr−1 with a small significant trend of −0.06 ± 0.03 Pg C yr−2 (increasing sink). Over the more limited period 1990–2004, the ocean models simulate a mean ocean sink of −2.2 ± 0.2 Pg C yr−1 with a trend in the net C uptake that is indistinguishable from zero (−0.01 ± 0.02 Pg C yr−2). The two ocean models that extended the simulations until 2009 suggest a slightly stronger, but still small, trend of −0.02 ± 0.01 Pg C yr−2. Trends from land and ocean models compare favourably to the land greenness trends from remote sensing, atmospheric inversion results, and the residual land sink required to close the global carbon budget. Trends in the land sink are driven by increasing net primary production (NPP), whose statistically significant trend of 0.22 ± 0.08 Pg C yr−2 exceeds a significant trend in heterotrophic respiration of 0.16 ± 0.05 Pg C yr−2 – primarily as a consequence of widespread CO2 fertilisation of plant production. Most of the land-based trend in simulated net carbon uptake originates from natural ecosystems in the tropics (−0.04 ± 0.01 Pg C yr−2), with almost no trend over the northern land region, where recent warming and reduced rainfall offsets the positive impact of elevated atmospheric CO2 and changes in growing season length on carbon storage. The small uptake trend in the ocean models emerges because climate variability and change, and in particular increasing sea surface temperatures, tend to counter{\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}-act the trend in ocean uptake driven by the increase in atmospheric CO2. Large uncertainty remains in the magnitude and sign of modelled carbon trends in several regions, as well as regarding the influence of land use and land cover changes on regional trends.},
