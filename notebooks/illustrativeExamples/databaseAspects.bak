# This illustrative notebook shows the interplay of all three packages on the collection of predefined models in bgc_md2 and ways to extend this collection by defining a new model that can be compared with respect to diagnostic variables that are computed using LAPM and CompartmentalSystems.

# ## Inspection with respect to common diagnostics
# The variable in the next cell is connected to the list above and will show a summary of the model you click. This summary contains not only the data the author of the model put into the database but also all the results that can be computed from it. It also contains a button to create a model specific notebook.

# ## Queriyng
# One purpose behind the unified (and therefore restricted)  representation of data of a database is the ability to select subsets. In bgc_md a record typically describes what we know about a model or a particular simulations.
# We demonstrate the querying capability by selectiong models for which the variables
# `VegetationCarbonInputPartitioningTuple` and `NumericSolutionArray` are defined or computable which indicates models that include vegetation pools and for which we also have enough example data to run a simulation.<p>
# **Fixme mm** <p>
#
# * There are no examples for the computation of a transit time or age density computation. Not even a variable with that name exists (in bgc_md2) yet.
