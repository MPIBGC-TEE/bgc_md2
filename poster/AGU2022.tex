  \subsubsection*{Development}
	{ \bf bgc\_md2 } is an open source python package availabe on { \bf GitHub} , developed at the { \bf Max-Planck-Institut for BioGeoChemistry} in Jena and more recently  in Yiqi Luo's {\bf Ecolab} at NAU in Flagstaff and {\bf Cornell} in Ithaca.
	It contains collection $>$ 30 published vegetation, soil or ecosystems models as {\bf python modules}
  in a format suitable  for symbolic (\texttt{SymPy}) and numeric computations.
	It provides as set of special datatypes that describe components of the models and functions that operate on these datatypes
	and a computability graph library to {\bf compute what is computable} that can be used for queries and inspection,
  enhancing the jupyter UI to assist the creation of new models. 

\subsubsection*{Transparent Symbolic Analysis/ Numeric Computations/ Data Assimilation}
	  \begin{itemize}
	    \item 
      interactive jupiter widget with a table of models (orange buttons can be clicked to 
	    expand or collape a more detailed view of the particular model),
	    \item 
	    model inspection with pool connection graph, which can be derived from the symbolic description
	    along other symbolic properties as flux equations and the compartmental matrix,
	    \item 
      Zoom into IPython/Jupyter UI showing methods automatically added by the computability graph library. 
	    \end{itemize}
	  
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{TabScreenCombined.pdf}
	  \begin{itemize}
	    \item 
      Dataassimilation with automatically created numeric model (from symbolic description), 
	    \item 
      Computability graph for a desired diagnostic (aggregated Flux from the vegetation to soil part, showing 
      that the user has to provide more information to compute the desired result)

\subsubsection*{Integration with python tools }
  %\begin{itemize}

   \texttt{bgc\_md2} can be used with all the normal python tools, \texttt{DASK, Jupyter, NumPy, SciPy, SymPy,\dots}
  %\end{itemize}

  \subsubsection*{Sibling \texttt{python} packages}

  \begin{tikzpicture}[sibling distance=27em,
    every node/.style = {shape=rectangle, rounded corners,
      draw, align=center,
      top color=white, bottom color=red!20}]
      \node {
      \begin{tikzpicture}[anchor=center]
        \node {
        \texttt{bgc\_md2}
        }
        child { node {\texttt{ComputabilityGraphs}} }

          node (LAPM){\texttt{LAPM}}

      };
  	%\draw[->] (LAPM) -- (SymPy); 
    \end{tikzpicture}
    };
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}

      \texttt{bgc\_md2} is a thin frontend to other \texttt{python} packages. 
      The computability graph computation is outsourced into our package \texttt{ComputabilityGraphs} 
	    Many of the advanced diagnostic variables (age and transittime distributions) are computed using our other packages \texttt{LAPM} and \texttt{CompartmentalSystems} for which \texttt{bgc\_md2} acts as interface.

  	 child{node {Matrix(Fluxes)}}
  	 %child{node {Fluxes(Matrix,Pools)}}

      \end{tikzpicture}
      };
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}

    \texttt{bgc\_md2} is not just a collection of models, described as sets of varible of special type like fluxes or matrice, but also 
    a collection of functions whose arguments and return values have these types.
    These functions are here called \texttt{computers} and use python type annotations.
    The computability graph used in the user interface and queries is derived from the 
    annotations of a set of functions.
    The set of properties (defined by the types) can be easily expanded, as well as the functions connecting them.

  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \subsubsection*{Database Records are \texttt{python} modules too}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{source.py.png}
    The picture shows the screen shot of the source code of the above model using sympy and some datatypes provided by \texttt{bgc\_md2}.
    The entries of the database do not have to be complete models. They are implemented in normal python and 
    have in common that they define a set of model properties and a set of functions to connect them.
    wicht are summarized in a \texttt{CMTVS} object (ConnectedMultytypeVariableSet). 
    The creation of all the variables including the the symbolic formulation can be automated by all means available in python.
    Information can but does not have to be provided, and is used to dynamically determine what is computable.

  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \subsubsection*{Expandability}
  \texttt{bgc\_md2} and it's sibling packages can acquire new functionality in several ways.
  Ranging from a project defining new models, to full integration by providing new Datatypes and functions
  for the computability graphs.
