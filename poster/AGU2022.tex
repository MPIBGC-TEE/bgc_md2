  \subsubsection*{Purpose}
  The main purpose of the package is to make models
  {\bf transparent}. One of the best ways to achieve this is to facilitate comparisons
  to other models. It is also the most difficult to implement.
  While it does not take much effort to make a model available on github, finding the right
  generalizations to express {\bf many} models in a {\bf comparable} way faces two main difficulties.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
  To make common diagnostics available, generalizations that include all models have to be found.
  \item
  Since models are formulated in different ways, the language to describe them should 
  not be restrictive but be as flexible as possible.
  \end{itemize}
  
  Our approach is to compare not was is formulated in the model description but what is 
  {\bf automatically computable} from its building blocks. 
  E.g. models can be described using matrices
  or fluxes, whichever way is closer to the original publication.
  For equivalent formulations the same diagnostics are available.
  The set of computable properties can be computed and used to query the database 
  for candidates for a comparison even though property to be compared was never explicitly defined.
  Some of our diagnostics, like transit times and mean ages would be difficult to implement 
  on a per model basis, but become available to many models. 
  Model formulation is not micromanaged, encouraging {\bf incomplete models} which can be inspected while 
  they are developed, greatly simplifying the {\bf creation of new models}.
  
  \subsubsection*{Development}
	{ \bf bgc\_md2 } is an open source \texttt{python} package availabe on { \bf GitHub}.
  Development started at the { \bf Max-Planck-Institut for BioGeoChemistry} in Jena in 2017 and more recently  continued in Yiqi Luo's {\bf ECO}LAB at NAU and {\bf Cornell}.
	It contains more than 30 published vegetation, soil or ecosystems models as {\bf modules}
  in a format suitable for symbolic (\texttt{SymPy}) and numeric computations.
  It is a more powerful {\bf successor to  SoilR}.

	      \item 
	      Model inspection with pool connection graph, which can be derived from the symbolic description
	      along other symbolic properties as flux equations and the compartmental matrix,
	      \item 
        Zoom into IPython/Jupyter UI, showing methods automatically added by the computability graph library. 
	    \end{itemize}
    \item Bottom row:  
	    \begin{itemize}
	      \item 
        Data assimilation with an automatically created numeric model (from symbolic description), 
	      \item

        that the additionally needed information to compute the desired result)

\subsubsection*{Many diagnostics for many models}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Many diagnostics (including those that are difficult to implement) available to all models 
\item
  Focus on model properties by exclusion of algorithmic differences
  (diagnostics for all models are computed by the same function )
\item
  Higher reliability (>100 unittests for many parts of the library, newly discovered errors have to be fixed
  only once)

  \subsubsection*{To Do / Development/ Levels of contribution}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Easy:
      Applcation of the existing functionality to more scientific questions and data,
      formulation of new models (including {\bf yours}), 
      improvement of the documentation (example notebooks, tests, and python docstrings)
    \item Medium:
      Implementation of new diagnostic variables and algorithms to compute them 
    \item Final:
      Integration of new building blocks and fucntions into the computability framework
      to make them much more easily accessible
